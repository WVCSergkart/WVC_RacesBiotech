	<description>Undeads are partially immortal, rapidly aging xeno-humans. Their genes are quite unstable and often their health can cause death, their bodies are very fragile, which is why even a fist fight can be fatal for them. In compensation, they can reanimate the dead by turning them into their own kind, and death is not always the end for them.</description>

	<description>Resurgents are a undead sub-xenotype, powered by archotech-created archites in the bloodstream. Resurgents always have the genes of undead xenotype. They are fragile and dependent on resurgent cells. They can regrow lost limbs, never age, and their wounds can close almost instantly. However, their immune system, stomach, blood, disease resistance, their entire body is dependent on these cells. And if the level of the cells is too low, they lose almost all of their special abilities.</description>
