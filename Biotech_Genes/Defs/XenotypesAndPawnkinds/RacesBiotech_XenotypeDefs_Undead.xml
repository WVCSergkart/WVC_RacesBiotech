	<description>Undeads are partially immortal, rapidly aging xeno-humans. Their genes are quite unstable and often their health can cause death, their bodies are very fragile, which is why even a fist fight can be fatal for them. In compensation, they can reanimate the dead by turning them into their own kind, and death is not always the end for them.</description>
