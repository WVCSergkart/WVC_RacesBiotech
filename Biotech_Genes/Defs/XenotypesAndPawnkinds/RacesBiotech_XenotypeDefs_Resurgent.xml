	<description>Resurgents are a undead sub-xenotype, powered by archotech-created archites in the bloodstream. Resurgents always have the genes of undead xenotype. They are fragile and dependent on resurgent cells. They can regrow lost limbs, never age, and their wounds can close almost instantly. However, their immune system, stomach, blood, disease resistance, their entire body is dependent on these cells. And if the level of the cells is too low, they lose almost all of their special abilities.

&lt;color=#f5ffa2&gt;Gameplay Effect:&lt;/color&gt; Resurgents always spawn as undead sub-xenotypes. Even in cases where they were obtained with the help of serums.</description>
