	<!-- Mysterious origins, strange appearance, unstable genes, natural hatred for anything different -->
	<description>Their origin is not known for certain. They were first discovered, on the outskirts of the agrarian world, on the borders of the empire. During the outbreak of the plague, strange creatures with pitch-black skin and no face began to appear. They acted quietly and exclusively under the cover of night, their target was mainly people who were dying. Some claimed to have seen the outlines of missing relatives in some of these creatures. It is not exactly established whether they were directly related to the plague or it was just a coincidence.\n\nRogkinds do not formally have a face. More precisely, their face is half-covered with something like a plate, which is transparent from the inside. Their skin is very sensitive to the sun, to the point that wounds stop healing when exposed to direct sunlight. Rogkind genes are somewhat unstable and can mutate over generations. On their own, they do not have the ability to reproduce naturally, but they do have an organ that can reimplant their germline into others.\n\nSocially speaking, Rogkinds are not very social. At least not with those who are very different from them. And adding up all of the above, the only way to communicate with them is to become like them.</description>
	<!-- <description>Rogkinds are a type of archotech-enhanced xenohuman. Powered by archites, their abilities go far beyond normal genetic enhancements. They carry a huge number of interchangeable genes, which makes their genome unstable and unpredictable. Their strengths and weaknesses always differ from individual to individual. But a few things are the same for them. Rogkinds genetically hate those who are different from them and they can spread "their essence".\n\nTheir origin is not known for certain, but all representatives of this xenotype are sterile. Rogkinds reproduce by reimplanting their own genes into others, transforming them into their own kind.</description> -->
	<descriptionShort>Rogkinds are ageless super-humans powered by archotech-created archites in the bloodstream. They are moderately strong. They do not suffer from disease or poison. Their genes are kind of unstable, which makes their metabolism vary from individual to individual. They can easily implant their genes, transforming anyone into their own kind. The price of all this is their vulnerability to the sun and a very bad relationship with everyone.</descriptionShort>
