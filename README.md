# Xenotypes and Genes
The mod has a page on Steam, the Steam version is updated much less frequently. Either with major updates or with bug fixes.

Keep this in mind. Since the _wiki is updated relative to the repository_.

[Release](https://github.com/WVCSergkart/WVC_RacesBiotech/releases) or [Steam page](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2886992038)

## Focus
The main focus of the mod is on xenotypes, and only then on genes. First of all, when creating mechanics for genes, I create them for xenotypes that I plan to add.

So if you are interested in genes within a certain style, for example, mechanoid-like, then I recommend looking at xenotypes first. Their gene sets should contain most of the genes of this style.

## Updates
Despite the fact that the mod has already passed version 1.0.0, it still continues to be updated and supplemented with new content.

I try to make major updates compatible with old saves and always create snapshots before making destructive changes.

Therefore, for protracted playthroughs lasting half a year or a year, it is **strictly recommended!!** to use the **GitHub version!!** of the mod, and not the Steam one.

## DLC compatibility and support
The mod has full support for all released DLCs up to the Anomaly.

All genes were created and designed taking into account the DLC and should not have any logical or technical conflicts with them.

The mod also has a built-in auto-patcher for the Anomaly. Genes that should not work with mutants are automatically blacklisted.

## Performance impact
Performance impact is always a sticking point for big mods, and this mod is far from small and has a lot of complex mechanics.

I made this mod with priority on minimal impact on performance, modification of vanilla code using harmony is kept to a minimum, and most functions using harmony can be disabled in the mod settings.

The mod **should have no impact on performance** if you don't use _things_ from it, and when you do, the impact **should be as low as possible**.
